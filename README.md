# NFT MIXTAPES
Create mixtapes as NFTs.

### Stack
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [Hardhat Hackathon Boilerplate](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate)
- Helps to have Metamask installed.

## Todo
- use [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) for tokenURI and store that on IPFS.
    - (Right now the tokenURI is just a bogus string so I could test it was working)
- Integration with Spotify / Soundcloud for song urls?
- Improve tokenURI metadata to include song links, mixtape title, possibly artwork.
- How to actually buy mixtape NFT?
- Improve test coverage
