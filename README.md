### Questions
- Do we want the song urls to be spotify or soundcloud?
    - **Spotify:**
    Spotify API fairly easy to use. People value spotify playlists a lot more. Could be interesting to make it so whoever is the owner of the NFT can add songs to the playlist (increasing it's value perhaps, you could make the really contrived argument that a certain NFT playlist is really popular on spotify so a musician bids on it so they can add their own songs for publicity.)
    - **Soundcloud:**
    Can play full songs from soundcloud links (Spotify is just 30 second preview) so an in browser "listening room" where you could load your NFT mixtapes and listen to them could work out better with soundcloud vs spotify.
- Harberger Tax on NFT? If you want to be the one to own it and add songs you have to continuously pay tax.

### FAQs
- _Why am I doing this?_
It doesn't seem like anyone has minted playlists as NFTs yet, so it seems like an amusing and interesting way to learn a bit more about NFTS.
